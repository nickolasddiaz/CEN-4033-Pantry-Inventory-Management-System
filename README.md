# CEN 4033 Pantry Inventory Management System


# Project Description
Students are asked to work in teams to design and implement a Pantry Inventory Management System,
which is s a simple web-based app that allows users to track the items they have in their pantry, manage
expiration dates, and create shopping lists for missing items. The system enables users to add, edit, and
remove pantry items, while also providing features for setting reminders for products nearing their
expiration dates. Core features are listed on the next page. Teams are asked to create Software
Requirements Specification (SRS), design documents, and implement a software functional prototype,
using one of the SDLC software development models. The list of deliverables for the team project is shown
below.

# Core Features of the Pantry Inventory Management System
- User Authentication
Users must be able to sign up and log in securely. This ensures that each user’s pantry inventory
is private and protected. Passwords shall be securely stored.
- Pantry Item Management
Users can add new items (name, quantity, expiration date), update existing items, and delete
them. Each item is linked to a user’s account and can only be modified or removed by that user.
- Shopping List Creation
The system will allow users to create a shopping list based on items that are out of stock or near
their expiration date. The list can be easily marked as "purchased" once the user buys the item.
- Expiration Date Reminders
Users will be notified or reminded about items that are nearing their expiration date. This can be
as simple as a list view that highlights items expiring soon, and can later be expanded with more
advanced notification features.
- Basic Security Measures
    * Input validation: Ensuring that all user inputs (e.g., item names, expiration dates, and
quantities) are clean and free from malicious code.
    * Role-based access control: Users can only see and edit their own pantry items.
    * Session management: Ensures that the user stays logged in securely during their
interaction with the system. 

# Workflow
we are using php for the backend MySQL for the database and html/css/javascript for the front end.
